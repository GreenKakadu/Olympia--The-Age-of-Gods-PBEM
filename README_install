Installing and Running Olympia: The Age of Gods

Olympia was orginally written by Rich Skrenta, with the Age of Gods
derivation by Scott Turner.  Much thanks goes to them for open-sourcing 
the code for these great games, offering a glimpse under the hood of early
Play-By-Email gaming.  I have simply done some clean-up on the code
to get it running under gcc 4.2 and documented how to start a game.
It seems to work, but there are no guarantees.  -- "Valen", October, 2010

This guide is written to work on a Mac running OSX 10.6.4, but should
work under linux (or Windows running Cygwin) as well.  It is compiled 
using the gcc compiler with the -m32 flag (32-bit option).

o using Macports (or apt-get or whatever if under linux):

  1) install getmail
  2) install msmtp
  3) install curl-ca-bundle

o Create a game account on the host computer.  If you need to find/replace
  in the code, the default is user "tag" with home directory /Users/tag

o Create a game email address someplace (could be gmail.com)

o Create the .getmail/getmailrc file to point to the mail server:
-------------
[retriever]
type = SimplePOP3SSLRetriever
server = pop.gmail.com
username = XXXXXX
password = YYYYYY

[destination]
type = Maildir
path = ~/incoming/

[options]
verbose = 1
message_log = ~/.getmail/gmail.log
-------------

o mkdir ~/incoming
o mkdir ~/incoming/cur
o mkdir ~/incoming/tmp
o mkdir ~/incoming/old

o Create the ~/.msmtprc file:

-------------
account default
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
timeout 30
auth on
user XXXXXXX@gmail.com
password YYYYYYY
auto_from off
from testing
tls on
tls_starttls on
tls_trust_file /opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt
logfile /Users/oly/.outgoing/msmtp.log
-------------

o chmod 700 ~/.msmtprc
o chmod 700 ~/.getmail/getmailrc

o mkdir ~/.outgoing

o htpasswd -c -b ~/passwords.1 admin admin123

  to set up the password file (replace .1 with the game number, and admin123
  with a good password)

o Add to .profile (or .tcshrc or whatever):

   export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/Users/tag/bin

o configure the game source (src):

  grep for all lines that say UPDATE and fix the addresses:

  1) edit eat.c glob.c main.c times.c and change email addresses and URLs
  2) edit glob.c to set the reply_host and the from_host email address

  edit oly.h and set the DEFAULT_PASSWORD to something new, since the 
  code is out in the wild

o build the game source (src):

  1) make
  2) make install

o edit the utilities source (utils):

  1) cd ~/utils
  2) addplayer.pl:  fix $accountDir and $libHome
  3) build.sh:  fix TARGET if needed
  4) checkmail.pl:  $mailDir, oldMailDir, $spoolfile, $charEmailFile,
          $moderator_email, $game_email
  5) scanner
  6) tagacct.c: ACCT_and OLD_ACCT_DIR

o build utilities (utils):

  1) sh build.sh

o build mapgen:

  1) cd ~/mapgen
  2) edit mapgen.c and make sure the #define for gates is as needed.  For
     TAG, the suggested setting are to turn on the continental gate tour
     and turn off the others.
  2) make
  3) make install

  Note that the mapgen tool is from Olympia G2 (earlier version), but seems
  to work with TAG without trouble.  It is slightly modified to allow
  variable sized maps and to wrap N-S as well as E-W as per the TAG rules.

o create the map

  1) edit Map, Regions (see README in mapgen directory, and example)
  2) run mapgen
  3) mkdir ~/lib (make sure no ~/lib exists, first)
  3) cp gate loc road ~/lib

o configure the lib (main database).

  1) cp -r ~/new/* ~/lib
  2) follow directions in ~/lib/README for editing "system" and setup

o mkdir ~/accounting

o make some first user accounts:

  in top level directory:

    addplayer.pl <factionID> <character name> <start city> <faction  name> <email> <player name> <nation> <game#>
e.g.:
    addplayer.pl aa0 "Bart Simpson" "aj9a" "The Simpsons" bart@someadress.com "My Name" "Imperial Empire" 1
    addplayer.pl aa0 "Bart Simpson" "" "The Simpsons" bart@someadress.com "My Name" "Imperial Empire" 1

  this preps the new account, which will be added when the turn is run

o initial run to get started:

  1) mkdir -p ~/lib/save/1
  2) olytag -aiMS -l ~/lib
  3) exit with control-D


o Install getmail crontab:

  * * * * * /opt/local/bin/getmail > /dev/null 2> /dev/null  # get every minute

o Install the documentation

  1) cd ~/doc
  2) make
  3) move it to a web site

o Install crontab for runforever.pl:

  * * * * * /Users/tagtest/bin/runforever.pl > /dev/null 2> /dev/null  # get every minute

  o Starts "checkmail.pl &", which polls the mail directory and copies to the oly spool

  o Starts "scanner &", the continuously-running order eater

o you can use "tagstatus" to check if checkmail.pl and scanner are running

To run a turn:

o touch ~/pause (and wait a minute, or kill olytag)
o touch ~/lib/spool/stop (stops order eater)
o cd
o olytag -l ~/lib -r -S  (run and save)
o olytag -l ~/lib -M (mail turns)
o scanner & (restart order eater)
o it's probably good to save the state (backup lib directory) before running
  each turn
o rm ~/pause

To use "immediate" mode to test things out or fix problems:

o touch ~/pause (and wait a minute, or kill olytag)
o olytag -i -l ~/lib
o type "h" to get a list of commands (trial and error)
o if you want to save your changes, type "save".  You may want to keep a 
  backup of your lib directory if you do this.
o rm ~/pause
