      <p><b>From Turn #79:</b></p>
      <p><tt>1) The nazgul invasion stack is on its way to meet the Pen boat.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please move into [hu9z] once we reach [al58].&nbsp; They 
        are waiting for</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; us, and will set sail as soon as we are on board.&nbsp; 
        I'll check to make</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; sure our stack capacities don't sink the boat (we should 
        be OK).</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; We should arrive in Mandoria in about 4 turns.</tt> </p>
      <p><tt>2) Our Pen friends have scried two Mandorian stacks:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Blazers are still located in Brine City in [av54].&nbsp; 
        They must be</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waiting reinforcements, and finishing making 
        their army (no details</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the makeup of their force, just the location</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Mandorians who are chasing The Gods and Shining 
        Force are located</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in [av29], so it looks like we managed to 
        put some distance between</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us and them, for now.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the plans for these factions?&nbsp; 
        They moved away</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the boat, but I can meet them at [aw23] 
        during turn#81.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know if you want to be picked up or 
        not, so I can have my</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sailor go do other things.</tt> 
      <p><tt>3) A Domingo book went on sale in Hyksos.&nbsp; Hopefully, we can 
        purchase</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; it.&nbsp; I will have my assassin turn around, and he 
        will be in Hyksos</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; by the end of this month.&nbsp; I will have him learn 
        Domingo, and he</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; will be able to fly undetected and kill more Mandorians.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Arthur, I will still send him your way (I want to 
        assassinate the</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; rest of the Blazers), but it will be a turn or two later.&nbsp; 
        It looks</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; like you should be OK until then, since they are still 
        in Brine City.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Brine City threat is taken care of, I will 
        have him visit</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenka and finish off the Mandorians there who hold the 
        castle.</tt> 
      <p><tt>4) Summing up our current plans, as I understand them (please correct, 
        if</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't agree):</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - send 40 nazgul + Timeid priest to Mandoria to suprise 
        attack</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calldwr castle.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - continue to garrison our cities in Imperia, as well 
        as possible</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entry points for Mandorians.&nbsp; This should 
        include:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ilya, and raze the castle 
        there, too.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Lookfar</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ap75 (the gate province; 
        Sir Arthur, are you close enough to do</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this one, and 
        give it some gold?)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - make sure our 3 castle are well-defended, especially 
        Aztec Glory's since</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is closest to the Imperial stack:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I am building an army 
        in Eldead, and can move down to help</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with defense</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - my assassin is coming, 
        too, in a couple of turns</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - breed more nazgul, and try to breed some dragons</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jupiter, please let me know if you want me to pick 
        up some of the</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobles in Mandoria.&nbsp; What are their 
        plans?</tt> 
      <p><tt>I'm sure I left out some things.&nbsp; Any comments?&nbsp; I just 
        want to make sure</tt> <br>
        <tt>we are all on the same page.&nbsp; If you are planning anything else 
        exciting,</tt> <br>
        <tt>please let the rest of us know.</tt>
