      <p><b>From turn#117:</b></p>
      <p><tt>Hi guys,</tt> </p>
      <p><tt>Well -- the enemy stack let by Merlot is not nearly as strong</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>as the one we just defeated.&nbsp; It is just a matter of catching</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>them and we can defeat them.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Now that they know the strength of the army near Hyksos, they</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>may decide to run away.&nbsp; They can evacuate through the gate</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>by day#9 or so, if they desire.&nbsp; I don't see them approaching</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>Hyksos (and certain death).&nbsp; They might run back to Lookfar</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>to rendevous with their ships, but it seems easier to take</tt> <br>
        <tt>the gate route back to Mandoria.&nbsp; Finally -- we haven't seen</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>any reinforcement on the other side of the gate, besides all</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>those mages.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think they will send more troops 
        through.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Their options:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;1) run away through gate (smart)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;2) run back to ship (OK... but we could catch them with a flying</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stack)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;3) move north to our other garrisoned cities, to continue</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garrison bashing (not really smart, but that's 
        what they've<br>
        recently)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;4) move to ap75 (gate province) and join with some mages for</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional protection.&nbsp; Sir Andrew doesn't 
        think this will happen</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (too risky for mages), and I would tend to agree.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Our options:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 1) send army to ap75 to attack whoever is left there.&nbsp; 
        We can</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrive by day#25 or so with the entire stack 
        from Hyksos.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 2) send a flying stack of 100+ nazgul and heavy xbowmen out</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to greet them (a little more risky on our 
        part)</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 3) some combination of #1 and #2</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;My thought is to send the strongest "defense tactics" nobles 
        with</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;the rest of the nazgul to join the army as it moves to ap75.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;If we catch them in ap75, then we will have a fairly easy victory</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;(according to the simulator).&nbsp; We might also be able to 
        take out</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;some of the enemy mages at the same time.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;We can scry Merlot on day#30, so we will know where they went 
        if</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;we can't find them.&nbsp; Then, the nazgul force can break off 
        and hunt</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;them down if they are still in Imperia.&nbsp; This seems like 
        the safest</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;bet.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;In the mean time, the Eres priest can move down and cast a</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;really nasty storm over that province, and we will seal off 
        the</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;gate for good.</tt>
