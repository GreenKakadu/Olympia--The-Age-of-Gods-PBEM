 <b>From turn#117: 
      </b> 
      <p><tt>> My Preliminary thoughts are:</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> 1. Shroud both Castle locations A.S.A.P.</tt> </p>
      <p><tt>Thorbardin now has a 200-point shroud.&nbsp; We need to get Tiamat</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>to Hyksos this turn to do the same, there.&nbsp; It will take a</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>reorganization in Thorbardin, since he is the stack leader</tt> <br>
        <tt>and castle-sitter.&nbsp; All our troops need to be stacked under</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>someone with "prot from aura blast" and "fight-to-the-death",</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>and I'm not sure we have anyone else in Thorbardin who fits</tt> <br>
        <tt>that description at the moment.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;</tt> <br>
        <tt>> 2. Recover our dead that were aura blasted and rez</tt> <br>
        <tt>> them A.S.P.</tt> 
      <p><tt>We only lost one, and, alas, the poor soul was not dedicated</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>to a priest...</tt> 
      <p><tt>> 3. Plan an attack on Merlot and friends maybe using</tt> <br>
        <tt>> Naz and H crossbow at flying speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; ( We must press</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>> on now we have the advantage).</tt> 
      <p><tt>I will work on a battle sim today at lunch.&nbsp; We may have</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>a problem if they link up with their mages (fireball</tt> <br>
        <tt>comes to mind, here).</tt> 
      <p><tt>> 4.&nbsp; Continue with the plan with the concealed</tt> <br>
        <tt>> scouts.</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> 5.&nbsp; I will take the prisoners and place them in the</tt> <br>
        <tt>> Hyksos castle and try to bribe as many as possible.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Some of the prisoners are oath-1.&nbsp; In fact, none of the</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>ones I've visioned so far are of contract loyalty.&nbsp; I</tt> <br>
        <tt>would execute those and exhume the bodies so that the</tt> <br>
        <tt>necromancers can't get them and eat the brains.</tt> 
      <p><tt>> I will station one noble outside the castle with</tt> <br>
        <tt>> enough troops to capture anyone who escapes throughout</tt> <br>
        <tt>> the turn ( I have 4 spare Noble points, which could be</tt> <br>
        <tt>> used to create 4 more Dol priests)</tt> 
      <p><tt>You mean outside the city, right?&nbsp; I'll send a list of</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>the ones that might have contract loyalty, later, so you</tt> <br>
        <tt>don't waste your time on the oath ones.&nbsp; Though, I guess</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>you could try to "persuade oathbound" on the meanest of</tt> <br>
        <tt>those guys.&nbsp; You might get him to turn, but it could</tt> <br>
        <tt>take a long while at 2% chance per try....</tt>
