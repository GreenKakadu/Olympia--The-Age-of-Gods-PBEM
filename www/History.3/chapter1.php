      <h2 align="center">Chapter 1: The Great Decimation</h2>
      <p>As the author was not present in the early stages, I cannot eloborate 
        on all the details.&nbsp; However, the world began with a large number 
        of factions, which quickly dropped off to about 60-70 total.&nbsp; This 
        may have partly been due to the originally-planned 8-month length of the 
        universe's existence!&nbsp; Some early plans included a quick suprise 
        attack of Mandoria (if we could find it) while they were still organizing. 
        Apparently, this never came about. Early Imperials of great stature included 
        Lord Imrik the high assassin and Ceowulf of Essex. </p>
      <h3> Approximately turn#30</h3>
      The Incursos Coalition was formed, as a new group of factions entered the 
      world.&nbsp; Imperia had decayed and was all but lost up until this time.&nbsp; 
      However, this new group revitalized the war effort. 
      <h3> Turn#42:</h3>
      Rumors of a Mandorian stack in Imperia -- the first invasion of the war 
      if it's true. 
      <h3> Turn#43</h3>
      First combat in Imperia!&nbsp; One of our stacks has stumbles onto the enemy 
      force, which apparently entered into a heavily populated part of Imperia 
      via a gate.&nbsp; (<a href="turn43.php">Click here for the battle</a>).&nbsp; 
      Several Imperial nobles are captured. 
      <h3> Turn#44-46</h3>
      Defense plans ensue.&nbsp; The plan is to have two forces march toward the 
      enemy in [ap75].&nbsp; The first force is based in Lookfar; the second force 
      is gathering south of Hyksos. 
      <h3> Turn#47</h3>
      Purchased a map of Mandoria from the Pen. 
      <h3> Turn#48</h3>
      We have landed a force in Mandoria, and another one on Tenka (a Mandorian 
      controlled island south of Brine City). Defense forces continue to amass, 
      headed by Jocker.&nbsp; The enemy is headed by Vulpo. 
      <h3> Turn#50</h3>
      A 16-noble Imperial stack moves into [ap75] in the forest south of Saltstone.&nbsp; 
      Fortunately, a majority of the Mandorian stack led by Vulpo moved south 
      and victory was had over the remaining nobles led by Robin Hood.&nbsp; Vulpo 
      returned immediately after our stack left -- which was fortunate.&nbsp; 
      If Vulpo's stack had been there, the Mandorians would have slaughtered a 
      significant stack of Imperial nobles. Another Mandorian stack led by Anny 
      moved to [aq74] to do some scouting, and defeated another small Imperial 
      stack. (<a href="turn50.php">Battle Reports</a>) 
      <h3> Turn#52:</h3>
      Vulpo has begun moving south from the gate province of [ap75] (south of 
      Saltstone), killing one of our garrisons.&nbsp; Our force in Mandor captured 
      the western city of Nassic. (<a href="turn52.php">Battle Report</a>) 
      <h3> Turn#53</h3>
      Vulpo progresses to Saltstone in [an75], killing a garrison. 
      <h3> Turn#54</h3>
      Mandorians The Noo-noo and Tinky Winky (and friends) <a href="turn55.php">invade 
      western Imperia</a> at Brine City. 
      <h3> Turn#55</h3>
      In a suicidal attack, Jocker's forces are soundly defeated by Vulpo at the 
      Battle of Saltstone (<a href="turn55.php">Battle Report</a>).&nbsp; Things 
      are looking pretty dim, as most of a 16-noble army was lost to Vulpo's force 
      and to the wolves afterward. 
      <h3> Turn#57</h3>
      The stack led by Vulpo and Rana has grown, and are back in the gate province 
      of [ap75].&nbsp; Vulpo is struck dead by a lightning bolt! 
      <h3> Turn#59</h3>
      Rana <a href="turn59.php">arrives at Saltstone</a> and is now in command 
      of the Mandorian force. 
      <h3> Turn#60</h3>
      <a href="turn60.php">Rana goes on a rampage</a> through about 4 provinces, 
      killing multiple garrisons and arriving at Hyksos.&nbsp; The Imperial stack 
      in the fortress contains a significant number of nobles, but weak troops. 
      <h3> Turn#61 (Assassinations at Hyksos)</h3>
      There is still hope in Hyksos!&nbsp; An <a href="turn61-2.php">assassin 
      kills Rana</a>, Maneka (who knew how to survive a fatal wound...once...), 
      and Anny!&nbsp; Elsewhere, Tinkly Winky's force attacks Ilya, killing or 
      capturing 10 lightly-defended Imperial nobles.&nbsp; After this attack, 
      they entered the trading guild and murdered a lone nuetral Pen trader. (<a href="turn61.php">Battle 
      Report</a>) 
      <h3> Turn#62</h3>
      Cymryd Dhubghalen, the new Mandorian stack leader, moves into a tower outside 
      of Hyksos fortress, in order to avoid attack.&nbsp; The assassin gives away 
      his ID by accidentaly coming to the defense of a nazgul-wielding Imperial 
      noble.&nbsp; The Imperial force led by Fabrizio moves out of the castle 
      to attempt to draw the Mandorians into an attack, but they do not take the 
      bait. <br>
      (<a href="turn62.php">Province report</a>) 
      <h3> Turn#63</h3>
      Bufo becomes the head of the Mandorian army at Hyksos, which slips away 
      from the city and ends up at Balatea in [am74], killing a garrison along 
      the way.&nbsp; Tinky Winky's forces take West Ford with only a small fight 
      from the 15-man garrison. 
      <h3> Turn#64</h3>
      No news of Bufo or Tinky Winky -- presumably, they are still at Balatea 
      and West Ford. 
      <p><b><i>(note:&nbsp; at this point, and over the last 2-3 turns, a large 
        number of Imperial players have quit in order to concentrate on the new 
        pay games of TAG.&nbsp; Everything is extremely unorganized and there 
        is little communication for the next several turns, until we figured out 
        who was still in the TAG3 game. Apparently the Mandorians had a similar 
        problem -- but after the shakeout there are twice as many Mandorian nobles 
        as Imperials.)</i></b> 
      <h3> Turn#65</h3>
      The Mandorians have taken the castle at Ilya.&nbsp; There are now Mandorian 
      garrisons on Imperia soil: 
      <p><tt>Routes leaving Buffalo Plains:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; West, plain, to Buffalo Plains [as76], 7 days</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garrison [ag6q], garrison, Mandor Confederacy, 
        with 20 soldiers</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Border closed.</tt> 
        <br>
        and 
      <p><tt>Province controlled by Tara-Kan [r14], castle, in Painted Desert 
        [au70]</tt> <br>
        <tt>Ruled by Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn Qawwal [d2w], duke</tt> <br>
        <tt>Border closed.</tt> <br>
        <tt>Entrance fees:</tt> 
      <p>Bad news, indeed! 
      <p>A small stack of our nobles makes the mistake of stopping at Balatea 
        to purchase an ox, and is attacked by Bufo's forces. (<a href="turn65.php">Battle 
        Report</a>) 
      <h3> Turn #66-68</h3>
      Due to the effective breakup of the Incursos Coalition, it is not known 
      exactly what happened during this time frame.&nbsp; We expect that a large 
      number of nobles from inactive factions were hunted down and killed.&nbsp; 
      Communication is at an all-time low. 
      <h3> Turn #69</h3>
      <p>The slaughter of Imperial nobles continues, with 17 nobles killed or 
        taken prisoner this month alone. (<a href="turn69.php">Reports</a>)&nbsp; 
        This included the High Priestess of Eres, Lady Raven Darkwave, who was 
        captured by Tinky Winky while in her temple outside of Lookfar.&nbsp; 
        Bufo's forces attack Cleanbones and defeat the Imperial forces there.&nbsp; 
        Someone had better do something quickly!</p>
