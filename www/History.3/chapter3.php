      <h2 align="center">Chapter 3: Strikes and Counterstrikes</h2>
      <h3>Turn #77</h3>
      An annoying quirk of G3 was how quickly bodies would decompose (or not) 
      before the chance to resurrect them.&nbsp; At this point, we only have about 
      eight priests left, and one of the most powerful, Lord Rodella was recently 
      killed by the nazgul that inhabit every province of Imperia. <a href="turn77.php">The 
      Fates are annoying, indeed</a>, in this case. 
      <p>In the meantime, we discover a castle at ar66, in the mountains southeast 
        of Eldead.&nbsp; This makes 4 in Imperia -- too many to defend with our 
        present situation of being badly outnumbered. 
      <h3> Turn #79</h3>
      <a href="turn79.php">Plans for a quick counter-strike are underway</a>, 
      with a stack of nazgul on its way to Mandoria.&nbsp; Thanks to the Pen for 
      their help. 
      <p>We are regarrisoning all our provinces and securing our borders for the 
        next wave of Mandorians.&nbsp; Brine City, at the extreme western tip 
        of Imperia, is thought to still be occupied.&nbsp; Tenka, southwest of 
        Imperia, is in the hands of the Mandorians, while the Pen occupy a castle 
        in Catarack (northwest of Imperia). 
      <h3> Turn #81</h3>
      <a href="turn81.php">Jupiter and company escape</a> Mandoria in a tiny 
      2-hull ship captained by Phantasm (the only remaining sailor in Imperia). 
      <h3> Turn #82</h3>
      A Mandorian ship containing a small armed force <a href="turn82.php">was 
      seen sailing north</a> through Penhome toward Catarack.&nbsp; This puts 
      a major kink in our planned invasion of Mandoria.&nbsp; The stack of Imperials 
      has temporarily stopped in Catarack to study for a couple of turns, and 
      it will give away our position if they attack the Pen stationed there.&nbsp; 
      Of course, the Pen are neutral, we are paying them for transportation, so 
      the enemy couldn't be trying some Pen ethnic cleansing, could they?&nbsp; 
      We will station part of our force where the enemy ship will land (if they 
      arrive), and attack them before they can move off of the boat.&nbsp; The 
      rest of our nobles will hide inside the city and emerge later to continue 
      our invasion of Mandoria. 
      <h3> Turn #83 (Battle of Catarack)</h3>
      If there was ever a poorly thought-out plan, that was it.&nbsp; As it turns 
      out, there were *three* boatloads of Mandorians instead of just one.&nbsp; 
      The Battle of Catarack proceded like this: 
      <ol>
        <li> A combined force of Pen and Imperials, large enough to destroy the 
          single enemy boat, <a href="turn83-1.php">attacked the ship</a>.&nbsp; 
          The problem was that all three boats of Mandorians joined forces before 
          we were able to attack.&nbsp; Qarama of the Royal Pen Navy led the assault, 
          and was defeated by Diphtheria and company after taking heavy losses.</li>
        <li> Diphtheria <a href="turn83-2.php">attacks the garrison and a couple 
          of lone Pen nobles</a> before moving west to al45 and the city of Clywd.</li>
        <li> In al45, the enemy force <a href="turn83-3.php">attacks the garrison 
          and enters Clywd</a>.</li>
        <li> The remaining Imperial and Pen nobles inside the city are <a href="turn83-4.php">ruthlessly 
          assaulted</a> and captured/killed.&nbsp; It is a very close battle, 
          as Diphtheria is the only remaining enemy noble left uninjured.&nbsp; 
          In fact, if Biguah had hit in the final round, the battle may have finished 
          in a tie.</li>
        <li> The enemy moves back outside the city and <a href="turn83-5.php">mops 
          up the remaining escaped nobles</a>.&nbsp; A couple of Pen remain inside 
          the castle, but there were terrible losses suffered this turn on Catarack.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Turn #84 (Battle of Catarack - Conclusion)</h3>
      To continue the muddled thinking that went into last turn's plan, it was 
      decided to attack the remaining enemy nobles outside of the castle.&nbsp; 
      The reasoning was two-fold:&nbsp; (1) the remaining two nobles could not 
      possible survive a seige, and (2) it might be possible to free the captured 
      nobles so why not throw caution to the wind and go for it.&nbsp; <a href="turn84.php">The 
      results were not pleasant</a>.&nbsp; The remaining Pen nobles did manage 
      to kill a couple more Mandorians, and the battle results were close again.&nbsp; 
      However, it probably would have been more prudent to calmly walk out of 
      the castle and back to the ship, sailing away with four nobles instead of 
      none. 
      <h3> Turn #85 (Battle of Catarack - Afterword)</h3>
      The final Pen noble helps cause the death of one more Mandorian before becoming 
      deceased.&nbsp; <a href="turn85.php">Funny</a>! 
      <p>As a result of this battle, the Royal Pen Navy was completely detroyed, 
        and the remaining Pen faction (Ind. Captains) has decided to side with 
        the Empire.&nbsp; Most of the Pen fleet was captured, including a couple 
        of 10-hull ships.&nbsp; Although only three Imperial nobles were lost, 
        we feel like this was a major loss that should have been an easy victory.&nbsp; 
        The greater loss was for the Pen, who lost about 12 nobles all together.&nbsp; 
        We will avenge your deaths, friends! 
      <h3> Turn #88</h3>
      Current plans: 
      <ul>
        <li> Jupiter's army is back in Imperia, and is assembling an army near 
          Chronos.&nbsp; The Pen are building a 30-hull ship to transport this 
          army</li>
        <li> The Mandorians seem to be building a castle at Brine City in Imperia 
          with stone collected on Tenka, a short sail south.&nbsp; We plan to 
          put an end to this, very soon, now.</li>
        <li> We need to recover the bodies from the graveyard on Catarack.&nbsp; 
          Those were a Timeid priest, a Dol priest, and one of our best fighters.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Turn #91</h3>
      Eidolon the assassin and Bishop of Domingo is captured while trying to assassinate 
      the Red Blazer in Clwyd.&nbsp; The recovery of bodies on the island fails. 
      <p>In other bad news, we also lost a priest of Dol, whose body rapidly decomposed 
        as well.&nbsp; We continue to lose far more nobles to the nazgul in the 
        wilderness than to the Mandorians!
