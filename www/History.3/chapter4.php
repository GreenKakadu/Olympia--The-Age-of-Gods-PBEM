      <h3>Turn #93</h3>
      The army in western Imperia is ready, and on their way to Brine City&nbsp; 
      to attack Mandorians there.&nbsp; After that, the 30-hull ship will be ready 
      to take them to Tenka. 
      <p>We lose two Kireus priest to nazgul.&nbsp; If this keeps up, we won't 
        have any nobles left to fight Mandorians! 
      <p>Things have slowed down a bit -- we are in planning mode.&nbsp; Everyone 
        is really busy. 
      <h3> Turn #94</h3>
      Jupiter's force arrives at Brine City, <a href="turn94.php">attacking five 
      Mandorian nobles</a> and razing the castle there.&nbsp; We were hopeful 
      for more, but this is a good start.&nbsp; Some of the Blazer clan, responsible 
      for the mess in Catarack, were captured and killed.&nbsp; We will continue 
      to hunt down every last one of those murderers, as well as their friends 
      the McDougals, until they are no more. 
      <h3> Turn #99</h3>
      Jupiter's army is finally at Tenka, thanks to the 30-hull mammoth Pen ship 
      (the "Pleasure Sloop", built by the Independent Captains).&nbsp; Red Blazer 
      and three other enemy ships containing a large number of troops were seen 
      off the western coast of Imperia.&nbsp; We believe that they are on their 
      way back for another invasion, probably near Chronos. 
      <h3> Turn #101</h3>
      Jupiter crashes into Riverwind, <a href="turn101.php">razing the enemy 
      castle</a>.&nbsp; The Mandorians have smartly fled.&nbsp; However, the Red 
      Blazer and friends are arriving, and so Jupiter's army meets the boat at 
      a different location and flees back to Imperia via a different route.&nbsp; 
      Mission accomplished, but not without a scare. 
      <h3> Turn #104</h3>
      A daring rescue mission to Catarack a few turns ago resulted in the recovery 
      of the body of Eidolon the assassin.&nbsp; Now, he is being ressurected 
      just in time for the new Mandorian force to arrive.&nbsp; There are <a href="turn104.php">five 
      enemy boats</a> near Imperia (that we know about).&nbsp; Most of these are 
      from the Pen fleet that the Mandorians captured at Catarack.&nbsp; If we 
      can catch one of them separate from the others, then Jupiter's force should 
      have an easy victory. 
      <p>In additon, we spotted an enemy spy, Sheila Carvalho.&nbsp; A vision 
        reveals she is a level 24 assassin who also knows bribery skills.&nbsp; 
        Very dangerous!&nbsp; We will track her each turn until we catch her. 
      <h3> Turn #105 (Battle of West Ford)</h3>
      <a href="turn105.php">Two stacks of Mandorian invade unpopulated western 
      Imperia</a>, bashing numerous garrisons.&nbsp; This group includes Merlot, 
      the McDougals, Blastic, and the Khaki Blazer. 
      <p>In southern Imperia (av67), a stack of Mandorians led by Mr. Yobos attack 
        a couple of Imperial nobles.&nbsp; The Mandorians are then defeated by 
        Jupiter's force in the battle that follows (<a href="turn105-2.php">report</a>). 
      <h3> Turn #106</h3>
      We lose more garrisons to Blastic and Bob McDougal.&nbsp; These are near 
      Chronos, which we were using for a staging area and shipyard.&nbsp; Time 
      to abandon that area and consolidate our troops near our primary cities 
      of Hyksos and Thorbardin. 
      <p>One of the enemy nobles we capruted last turn, Mr. Yobos, escaped.&nbsp; 
        However, the nazgul -- of which there seem to be an endless supply in 
        our lands -- got him before we could. 
      <h3> Turn #107</h3>
      We lose another couple of garrisons near Chronos.&nbsp; The Red Blazer shows 
      his face again near Brine City, along with Lastah del Coruna, Newun, and 
      Yancie.&nbsp; It seems that the enemy are going to again muster their forces 
      in another invasion attempt. 
      <h3> Turn #108</h3>
      The garrison at Eldead falls (no suprise there!)&nbsp; Foretunately, all 
      our nobles are long gone and have retreated back to safer territories.&nbsp; 
      The Mandorians can have western Imperia if they want it.&nbsp; Chronos and 
      Eldead were useful as a hiding place to build the 30-hull ship and Jupiter's 
      army earlier, but the real prize of Imperia is the central cities.&nbsp; 
      If they were to fall, we would be as good as finished. 
      <p>A new <a href="turn108.php">plan is hatched</a>.&nbsp; We may send a 
        flying army, primarily made up of nazgul and heavy crossbowmen, to Mandoria.&nbsp; 
        Stay tuned. 
      <h3> Turn #109-112</h3>
      Troop-building.&nbsp; In turn#111, three Mandorian vessels are located near 
      Brine City.&nbsp; Still not a huge force, but strong enough to give out 
      main army headed by Jupiter a fight, depending on the terrain.&nbsp; We 
      decide to abondon the castle at ar66 and consolodate out forces in Hyksos 
      and Thorbardin (in ao69 and ao73).&nbsp; It was a sad, but necessary moment: 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;3: > raze x76</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;9: Fortress of Hope [x76] collapses!</tt> 
      <h3> Turn #113</h3>
      What have the Mandorians really been up to recently?&nbsp; Coming up with 
      a new way to make us wet ourselves, that's what.&nbsp; <a href="turn113.php">A 
      new stack led by Wevor</a> has arrived in Imperia, apparently through the 
      gate in ap75.&nbsp; They are less than one month from our unorganized <a href="turn113-2.php">forces 
      in Hyksos</a>.&nbsp; Our army is still split, with more <a href="turn113-3.php">troops 
      at Thorbardin</a>, and a third force moving toward there. 
      <p>If that wasn't bad enough, the <a href="turn113-4.php">Red Blazer and 
        friends</a> are still lurking about, spotted in au75 this month.&nbsp; 
        If the enemy can keep our troops from joining together, and also manage 
        to merge their troops together, then they stand a good chance of dealing 
        us heavy losses and possibly of winning the war outright.&nbsp; Our position 
        is perilous;&nbsp; one set of blown orders could cost us dearly. 
      <p>We notice one interesting feature about the enemy army -- something that 
        we can use to our advantage to overcome their superior troops and numbers:&nbsp; 
        their missile troops are made up primarily of archers...and as we all 
        know, archers are useless in the rain.&nbsp; Hyksos in ao73 has a perpetual 
        rainstorm over it, cast by some Eres priest long ago.&nbsp; We make a 
        snap decision to send our troops into the ao73 province on the chance 
        that the enemy will move in and attack our force.&nbsp; That will give 
        us a free missile round with our crossbowmen (who still work in the rain, 
        albeit at a lower efficiency). 
      <h3> Turn #114-116</h3>
      Wevor bashes more garrisons.&nbsp; Red Blazer and company are still about.&nbsp; 
      But, for some reason they have not yet merged for a full frontal assault 
      (good thing for us, too!&nbsp; Find a status report <a href="turn116.php">here</a>. 
      <p>We drop off two spies in Mandoria to begin identifying every known Mandorian 
        noble and locating all of their castles.&nbsp; One of them is a concealed 
        Anteus priest (this is possible in G3, but not in later versions of TAG.) 
      <p>One of our nobles in Hyksos Fortress gets aura blasted: 
      <p><tt>Thrix [n3v]</tt> <br>
        <tt>------------------------------------------------------------------------</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;2: Anthony the Wierd [a5j] blasts Thrix [n3v] with a burst of 
        aura!</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;2: Thrix [n3v] is wounded.&nbsp; Health is now 0.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;2: *** Thrix has died ***</tt> 
      <p>We will need to start mixing up our forces next turn so that no one noble 
        remains in the castle for long periods of time.&nbsp; We manage to <a href="turn116-2.php">vision 
        the perpetrator</a>. 
      <p>We note that Wevor's force is moving toward an73 (Cormyr), where it is 
        raining.&nbsp; After much debate, we decide to risk moving the army there 
        to take advantage of this opportunity to ambush the enemy. 
      <h3> Turn #117 (Victory at Cormyr)</h3>
      WHAM!&nbsp; An <a href="turn117.php">absolutely glorious victory</a> is 
      achieved over the main Mandorian stack, with minimal losses on our side. 
      <a href="turn117-2.php">Here is a summary</a> of the remaining forces and 
      <a href="turn117-3.php">our plans</a> (and <a href="turn117-4.php">more 
      plans</a>) at this point. 
      <h3> Turn #118</h3>
      Find a detailed summary <a href="turn118.php">here</a>.&nbsp; The highlight 
      was the collapse of the main enemy castle in Mandoria and an attack on the 
      mage in the gate province. 
      <h3> Turn #119 (Battle in Blackroot Wood)</h3>
      Our flying force <a href="turn119.php">catches Merlot's army</a> before 
      they can return to their ship or the gate.&nbsp; In the follow-up to last 
      month's battle, Magnus Yobos (nasty mage) is sent straight to Hades.&nbsp; 
      Good riddance, Mandorians!&nbsp; Now, you will pay for your sins against 
      the eight gods!
