      <h3>Turn #120-127</h3>
      After staving off the last major Mandorian threat, we spend months preparing 
      for the invasion of Mandoria.&nbsp; We will use two forces: the first will 
      be a flying force consisting of the nazgul that we've been breeding and 
      a bunch of heavy crossbowmen, and the second will be a sea-based force on 
      a 30-hull ship whose job it will be to hunt down the enemy navy.&nbsp; (<a href="turn120.php">some 
      details here</a>; and here is a <a href="turn126.php">summary from turn#126</a>, 
      which includes a bunch of bribed enemy nobles) 
      <h3> Turn #128</h3>
      We caught two enemy spies near our main cities of Hyksos and Thorbardin.&nbsp; 
      Good thing we had some guys seeking... 
      <h3> Turn #129-133</h3>
      Finalizing the <a href="turn132.php">war plans</a>, and putting them into 
      action.&nbsp; And, we manage to bribe one of the spies: 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 30: Yvette d'Alembert [v2g] pledges fealty to us.</tt> 
      <h3> Turn #134 (Attack of Tenka)</h3>
      The Pen ship and small army arrive at Tenka and blast into the city (<a href="turn134.php">reports</a>).&nbsp; 
      We miss most of the enemy nobles, who just moved to the northern end of 
      the island and seem to have gone into hiding.&nbsp; Alas, one of the enemy 
      ships has arrived as well.&nbsp; We will chase it, given the opportunity.&nbsp; 
      There is also a castle to raze, here, with a lone noble inside. 
      <h3> Turn #135</h3>
      The nazgul army moves in such a way that they will descend on ap20 (home 
      of several mages, and the other end of the gate to Imperia), Calldwr, and 
      Newbald all during the following month.&nbsp; The hope was to surprise the 
      enemy and kill off a large number of their mages.&nbsp; Unfortunately, someone 
      installed a garrison in the ao20 swamp that gave away our position.&nbsp; 
      Now, the enemy may be able to stack themselves in such a way that their 
      auraculated mages can cast fireball several times.&nbsp; Our stack would 
      still probably win, but not without losing a couple of hundred nazgul.&nbsp; 
      So, we will go with a different plan and come back to get the mages at a 
      later date. 
      <p>In the mean time, the spy Sheila Carvalho has been convinced to join 
        us!&nbsp; She is also on top of the enemy pledge chain, which means that 
        we can see all of their garrison reports.&nbsp; It has revealed the location 
        of more than half of the enemy nobles this turn.&nbsp; Check out our <a href="turn135.php">list 
        of enemy nobles</a> at this point, and you'll see that it's pretty complete.&nbsp; 
        Of course, we still have two other spies snooping around Mandoria as well. 
      <p>Apollo's small army continues to stalk Mandorians on Tenka who have gone 
        into hiding. 
      <h3> Turn #136</h3>
      The nazgul army decided to pass on the mage province of ap20, and instead 
      moves to au23 to attack the Mandorian castle.&nbsp; <a href="turn136.php">They 
      attack a lone Mandorian</a> noble on the way.&nbsp; Oops, the Mandorians<a href="turn136-2.php"> 
      forgot to close the drawbridge</a> to the castle in Twilight City!&nbsp; 
      And Sheila Carvalho, our new assassin, has issued decrees to the enemy garrisons 
      to attack certain enemy nobles.&nbsp; Three garrisons attack and lose, but 
      it probably gave the enemy a nice surprise.
<p>We have spotted a large group of enemy nobles with about 600 peasants 
        moving west from av33.&nbsp; We suspect that they are going to build a 
        city in aw28, so our army will be waiting for them when they arrive. 
      <p>On Tenka, we have figured out that the Mandorian nobles are hiding in 
        a ring of stones in the NE corner of the island. Time to go finish them 
        off.. 
      <h3> Turn #137 (Battle of Twilight City)</h3>
      <p>The army on Tenka <a href="turn137.php">finally catches the small enemy 
        stack</a>. As a bonus, the White Blazer has shown up in his ship, probably 
        to help evacuate the island. Too little, too late.</p>
      <p>In Mandoria, the <a href="turn137-3.php">main army attacks the enemy 
        nobles in Twilight City</a>. Osmosis, Sir Andrew and 80 nazgul break off 
        from the main stack to hunt down small stacks of enemy nobles. They catch 
        some nobles <a href="turn137-4.php">in a mine shaft</a> east of Twilight 
        City, and a <a href="turn137-2.php">necromancer in a graveyard nearby</a>.</p>
      <h3>Turn #138</h3>
      <p>Osmosis and Sir Andrew complete their <a href="turn138.htm">purging of 
        enemies from the mine shaft</a>, while the main army attacks the enemy 
        nobles at the <a href="turn138-2.htm">new city site</a>.</p>
      <p>The small army takes care of the <a href="turn138-3.htm">White Blazer</a> 
        and his stolen ship (from Catarack) on Tenka, and next will chase the 
        Teal Blazer toward Penhome.</p>
      <h3>Turn #139</h3>
      <p> <i>2: General Kraken [k3k] is too overloaded to fly</i>. OOPS!</p>
      <p>The Pen-led search-and-destroy mission <a href="turn139.htm">catches 
        up to the enemy</a> on Penhome.</p>
      <p>One of the enemy spies was spotted in the Hyksos province - we will try 
        to catch him.</p>
      <p>Sir Andrew and Osmosis <a href="turn139-2.htm">do some damage in Darkwind</a>, 
        but find Mandor City empty.</p>
      <p>Also of note:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">For the first time 
          since turn#63, the Empire has as many nobles as the Mandorians!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"> <b>Imperial Empire:</b></font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"><br>
          * Nobles (and controlled units): 79.<br>
          * Noble points: 205.<br>
          <b>Mandor Confederacy:</b><br>
          * Nobles (and controlled units): 79.<br>

          * Nobles (and controlled units): 13.<br>
          * Noble points: 19.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">In addition, we hold 
          18 prisoners, and have 3 prisoners in a place where they can't escape, 
          leaving them with 58 active nobles.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Turn #140</h3>
      <p>Osmosis messes up his &quot;fly&quot; orders, causing both he and Sir 
        Andrew to be stuck in Darkwind and struck down by a high-level enemy assassin. 
        These are the only Imperial causalities of the invasion. The nobles that 
        they were holding prisoner got away.</p>
      <p>In other news, we caught two enemy spies outside of Hyksos, and bribed 
        four enemies to join the Army of Light. Our Ham priests have sniffed out 
        some more of the enemy nobles, which have now taken to hiding in secret 
        locations. A lot of good that will do them...</p>
      <p>The enemy on Penhome have hidden inside a circle of trees, but they are 
        only delaying their impending doom.</p>
      <h3>Turn #141</h3>
      <p>The main army moves to the southeast coast in an attempt to attack a 
        stack of nobles near Gallys. Unfortunately, most of them have slipped 
        into another hidden location, but we do manage to <a href="turn141.htm">attack 
        a couple of nobles</a>.</p>
      <p>The small army sail to Catarack to sink a few enemy ships, then return 
        to Penhome to seek out the enemies still hidden there.</p>
      <h3>Turn #142 (Freedom for Penhome)</h3>
      <p>Kraken and the army <a href="turn142.htm">attack and raze</a> one of 
        two remaining Mandorian castles in Cedon, then catch some more enemy nobles 
        <a href="turn142-2.htm">west of Darkwind</a>.</p>
      <p>An enemy ship captain must have missed his orders, because he sails right 
        into the shipboard army at Penhome, who also<a href="turn142-3.htm"> finally 
        chases the enemy stack from their hidey hole</a>.</p>
      <h3>Turn #143 (Fighting in Central Mandoria)</h3>
      <p>The main army continues the slaughter, <a href="turn143.htm">attacking 
        a hidden mage</a>, then <a href="turn143-2.htm">one of the larger enemy 
        stacks</a> that was hidden halfway between Newbald and Darkwind. Yawn. 
        I guess that the fears of huge undead armies being hidden in Mandor were 
        totally unfounded. Interestingly enough, we spot another large hidden 
        stack of Mandorians in the next province over. We'll take care of them 
        next month.</p>
      <p>The Pen ship approaches the SE coast of Mandoria, preparing to finish 
        the work left by the main army.</p>
      <h3>Turn #144 (Attacks near Newbald and Gallys)</h3>
      <p>We <a href="turn144.htm">attack the hidden stack</a> we spotted last 
        month. Surely the Mandorians are almost out of nobles by now. Kraken's 
        army also found a couple more lone enemy nobles in the forests and quickly 
        dispatches them.</p>
      <p>Apollo leads the small army in <a href="turn144-2.htm">another attack 
        on Gallys</a>, this time capturing the full enemy contingent. It looks 
        like the war is almost over, with only a couple dozen enemy nobles still 
        out and about.</p>
      <h3>Turn #145</h3>
      <p><a href="turn145.htm">Two more minor battles</a> result in the capture 
        or death of a half dozen Mandorians.</p>
      <p>Some nazgul kill a Pen noble on Oleg's Folly. At this point, the Pen 
        own one castle and are close to completing another. However, they have 
        graciously offered to step out and let the win conditions be met. They 
        are the largest single faction remaining in the world.</p>
      <h3>Turn #146</h3>
      <p>We have been piecing together the location and makeup of the last large 
        Mandorian stack for a few months, now. They are located in a hidden location 
        in NE Mandoria. The real danger is their auraculated mages, who have rarely 
        been seen and have essentially been a non-factor in the war so far. With 
        a large enough front line, they could do some serious damage to our nazgul 
        stack and possibly delay our imminent victory by a substantial amount 
        of time. We will need to be very careful.</p>
      <p>General Kraken, the current stack leader, captures an assassin as we 
        enter the province...</p>
      <h3>Turn #147 (Priests versus Mages: The Final Battle)</h3>
      <p>The <a href="turn147.htm">final battle is upon us</a>! And, it goes fairly 
        quickly. Anthony the Wierd and Argyle the Fool are the two of the enemy's 
        three powerful mages, and though they pack a punch, their supporting army 
        is far to small to do very much damage to the Flying Nazgul Army of Death.</p>
      <h3>Turn #149 (Battle at Gandar)</h3>
      <p>Phantasm (Imperial) and Elisabeth (Pen) sail into Gandar, <a href="turn149.htm">killing 
        the last two enemy ship captains </a>(Flavian and Tan Blazer). It is a 
        sweet victory to finally defeat the the last of the Blazer clan after 
        all the innocent blood they shed, and to sink the remnants of the Mandorian 
        navy.</p>
      <p>The Pen have resigned their castle, and the winning conditions have been 
        met by the Imperials! Victory is finally ours! There is much rejoicing 
        in Imperial City, Hyksos, Thorbardin, Penhome, and all the free world! 
        The remaining Mandorians are mostly in Hades, and are unkillable. Hope 
        they rot there.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Thanks to everyone for a great game! It probably should have ended by 
        about turn#70, but most of the mid-game battles were great fun (the Mandor-stomping-Imperials 
        in the early going was probably fun for the Mandorians. The Imperials-stomping-Mandor 
        in the end-game were not as fun, but planning it was... :-)</p>
