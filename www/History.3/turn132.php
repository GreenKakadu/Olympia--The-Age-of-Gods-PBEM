 <b>From turn#132: 
      </b> 
      <p><tt>Hi guys,</tt> </p>
      <p><tt>Here's the spreadsheet.&nbsp; It unfortunately seems that Sir Arthur 
        bit</tt> <br>
        <tt>the dust, Domingo rest his soul.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Dorothy, could you please scry for the body? [m6d]&nbsp; Since he 
        died in the</tt> <br>
        <tt>middle of the ocean, it could be anywhere.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Lord Bane -- let me know if you want a flying escort to get the Domingo</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>book.&nbsp; We need to start studying that right away, so Arthur has 
        a</tt> <br>
        <tt>chance of being brought back to life.</tt> 
      <p><tt>The Big Army is flying to Mandoria.&nbsp; Stefano, please give the 
        staff</tt> <br>
        <tt>piece to a non-priest, since it gives away our location in TGS:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 1 piece of the Staff of the Sun 
        is held by priests.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * One piece is held on 
        The Outer Sea.</tt> 
      <p><tt>If we knew the location of some islands along the Mandorian shore,</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>then we could use them as a base of operations, striking from</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>the ocean each turn, and avoiding most scry attempts.</tt> 
      <p><tt>War plans:</tt> <br>
        <tt>------------------</tt> 
      <p><tt>Small army:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- one possibility is to sail to bb56 this turn, just off-shore 
        of</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenka, then land next turn and have the army into the 
        city by day#20.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Attack any nobles outside of the castle, then retreat 
        back to bb54</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; by the end of the turn.&nbsp; That will let us assess 
        the situation,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; and determine if the army needs to run away(!) or stay 
        and eliminate</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; the castle.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we are going in blind, we may as well have the 
        element of</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; suprise on our side!&nbsp; I only wish there was a way 
        to see inside the</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; city before we attack.</tt> <br>
        &nbsp; 
      <p><tt>Big army:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- Defeat the monsters that killed Sir Arthur, and get his stuff 
        back.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; My spy passed through the Mage Province last turn.&nbsp; 
        There are still</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; several mages in the area, and they are not stacked.&nbsp; 
        At least two</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; of them probably know fireball, but one could be overpowered 
        before</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; he is able to cast the spell.&nbsp; I suggest that we 
        attack there,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; first, and eliminate these since they are the biggest 
        threat.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thorg the Hero could be our ace-up-the-sleave, since 
        it gives us</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; an attack in the special attacks phase.&nbsp; We may 
        be able to defeat</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; the second mage, who has an escort, with the several 
        attacks we</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; will get before he can cast his spells.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, we should be able to shread the enemy to 
        little bitty</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces with our nazgul stack.&nbsp; And after all the 
        massive bloodshed</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; of Imperial nobles back in Imperia during turns 50-75 
        or so, and</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; the attempted total elimination of the Pen on Catarack, 
        it will</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; feel good to finally have some measure of revenge...</tt> 
      <p> 
      <hr WIDTH="70%">
      <p><tt>Well -- the time we have worked for is almost here!&nbsp; The total</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>destruction of the evil Mandorians is upon us.</tt> 
      <p><tt>This turn, the small army should enter Tenka and destroy everything</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>in sight.&nbsp; Ships, towers, Mandorian nobles, etc.&nbsp; We will 
        have to</tt> <br>
        <tt>concoct a good set of attack orders.&nbsp; Something like this:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 1) move off of ship</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 2) attack all enemy ship IDs</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 3) raze all enemy ship IDs</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 4) move to city</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 5) attack all known towers and "hostile Mandor"</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 6) run back to ship</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 7) re-enter city the next turn and finish the job, if the enemy</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; force there is small.&nbsp; Otherwise, run 
        away.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 8) sail on to Brine City, Catarack, Penhome, and other places</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where Mandorian ships might be sailing.</tt> 
      <p><tt>The big army should finish up just off the coast of Mandoria this</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; My thought is to move them as close to the Mandorian</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>mages as we can without being detected, and then attack the</tt> <br>
        <tt>mage strongholds of ap20 and ao22 (Newbald) on the same turn by</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>suprise.&nbsp; This should prevent their most powerful mages from 
        using</tt> <br>
        <tt>the Fireball spell effectively.</tt> 
      <p><tt>What the big army needs to do, IMHO:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 1) give the staff piece to a non-priest this turn.&nbsp; If 
        it is still</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving away our location in TGS after this 
        turn, then we need to</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop it someplace and pick it up later.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 2) scouts will locate a proper stopping spot for our army.&nbsp; 
        Perhaps</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the swamp at ao19-ao20 would be a good base 
        of operations, since</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Mandorians will not likely travel there.&nbsp; 
        This puts us in</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; position to carry out the suprise attacks 
        in about 3 turns.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 3) Stefano:&nbsp; when we arrive in Mandoria, cast "Guard 
        Loyalty" on</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every noble every turn.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 4) Ham priests: work through the entire list of known Mandorian</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nobles with "Receive Vision".&nbsp; This 
        should tell us where they</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are hiding.&nbsp; Shroud our location as 
        needed.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 5) Need to make sure the troops are distributed properly.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 6) Need to issue a "drop" command for all heavy items before 
        each</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move, so they can't stop us by giving a lone 
        noble a bunch of</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone or obsidian and letting us attack him.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 7) Fly to all cities and all newly-discovered hideouts quickly,</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with "hostile Mandor" set, to eliminate as 
        many nobles as</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; 8) Bribe/Persuade all the captured nobles, especially the 
        mages.</tt> 
      <p><tt>It should make a nice Christmas present for the Mandorians... :-)</tt> 
      <p><tt>What am I forgetting, here?&nbsp; Besides whether or not we should 
        accept</tt> <br>
        <tt>their surrender when it comes in about four turns, that is? :-)</tt>
