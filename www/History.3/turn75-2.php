        imperial or they knew Skydancer was there and already had 'attack r3y' 
        queued. My bet is on the former.</i><i></i> 
      <p><i>&nbsp;If so, we have a perfect opportunity to take out T-W for good. 
        They will no doubt attack Skydancer again, which will take up one day 
        and give us time to get our forces out into the mountains. Unless they 
        have anticipated this, the hostile I order will cause them to attack our 
        stack. We have more men, the mountain defense bonus, -and- a free missile 
        round. They wouldn't stand a chance.</i><i></i> 
      <p><i>&nbsp;By moving our forces out of the castle, we also all but negate 
        their chances of assassinating or Aura blasting one of our nobles.</i>
