      <p><b>From turn#108:</b></p>
      <p><i>An exchange between two Imperial lords:</i> </p>
      <p><tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Hello to all --</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> I've given our resources a thorough examination, and it seems that 
        we</tt> <br>
        <tt>> could really start doing some damage to the Mandorians guys in about 
        10</tt> <br>
        <tt>> turns or so.</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> The object:&nbsp; insert 120+ nazgul and 80+ heavy xbowmen on the 
        Mandorian</tt> <br>
        <tt>> mainland within 15 turns (realistically).&nbsp; Send a second wave 
        of</tt> <br>
        <tt>> reinforcements to replentish the losses taken by the first force 
        within</tt> <br>
        <tt>> about 5 turns after that.</tt> <br>
        &nbsp; 
      <p><tt>I think we should consider sending a larger force consisting of 4 
        front line</tt> <br>
        <tt>Nobles each with at least 40+ control beasts with a rear line of 4 
        nobles</tt> <br>
        <tt>with 50+ control men in battle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also ask you all&nbsp; 
        to consider</tt> <br>
        <tt>making the frontline nobles, priests of Halon and give them protection 
        from</tt> <br>
        <tt>Aura Blasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to send along a Guilded ranger 
        type and if</tt> <br>
        <tt>possible make him into a priest as well.</tt> 
      <p><tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> I think that our best chance will be to have 3-4 combat guild members 
        with</tt> <br>
        <tt>> "Use Beasts" level 40 or so, and Defense Tactics as high as possible.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>> The nobles controlling the heavy xbowmen should have Combat Tactics 
        as</tt> <br>
        <tt>> high as possible (no need for defense, there).</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> As we've discussed before, we need to make as many Dol priests as 
        we can</tt> <br>
        <tt>> in order to supply the main fighting force (nazgul).</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> We can fly all the way to Mandoria -- this should not be a problem.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> The candidate nobles:</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Beastmasters (fighters):</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Alexei Galantor [j7l] - UBIB 22, DT 50, CT 22</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Sunwalker [a8x] - UBIB 39, DT 50, CT 0</tt> <br>
        <tt>> Other potential beastmasters (without Defense Tactics yet) are:</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Sir Andrew [v9a] - UBIB 23, DT 0, CT 0</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Sir Charles [j5r] - UBIB 41, DT 0, CT 0</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Lucca [h0t] - UBIB 14, DT 0, CT 0</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Stefano [t8e] - UBIB 35, DT 0, CT 0,</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Johny [w2d] - UBIB 39</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> We have lots of nobles who could lead the archers (high CMIB, but</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>> need to practice Combat Tactics)</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> We also need to make more Dol priests!</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Current Dol priests:</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Sir Bruce [p6p] (High Priest)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Lord Francesco Bane [a2u] (Bishop; knows "create holy symbol")</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Lord Rodrigo Bane [c8b] (Bishop)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - The Bard [s2a]</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Sir Andrew is making a lot of holy symbols for new priests of Dol.&nbsp; 
        These</tt> <br>
        <tt>> guys have expressed interest in becoming priests:</tt> 
      <p><tt>I will continue to make them for a few turns,&nbsp; I need to know 
        how many we</tt> <br>
        <tt>need.</tt> 
      <p><tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Goon IV [c5z] (prisoner; Grant will bribe - if they survive 
        the</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journey!)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Goon III [b9v] (prisoner; Grant will bribe)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Phantom III [d6x] (in Lookfar)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Recruiter Dude [v3k] (if he survives the journey!)</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Venus [w5u] (ditto)</tt> <br>
        <tt>>&nbsp; - Windrunner [w3n]</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> As you may have noticed -- four of these guys are in dire straits, 
        and</tt> <br>
        <tt>> all are stacked together in ar69 with just 14 pikemen and 13 lgt 
        xbowmen</tt> <br>
        <tt>> to defend them... I'm not sure what to do about that situation, 
        except</tt> <br>
        <tt>> to cross our fingers for good luck... they started out OK, but had 
        to</tt> <br>
        <tt>> survive 2 nazgul attacks already...and there are more in their current</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>> province... anyone close by enough to help?</tt> <br>
        &nbsp; 
      <p><tt>Is there an inner location they can move into,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can 
        dispatach a large</tt> <br>
        <tt>rescue party this turn if needed.</tt> 
      <p><tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Anyway, if we are able to make all those new priests, then within 
        about 5</tt> <br>
        <tt>> turns we should be cranking out 25-30 nazgul per turn, which should 
        be</tt> <br>
        <tt>> plenty to wipe the Mandorians off the face of the earth within another</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>> 20 turns.</tt> <br>
        <tt>></tt> <br>
        <tt>> Finally -- my assassin is now an Anteus priest!&nbsp; He will make 
        a holy</tt> <br>
        <tt>> symbol in a couple of turns, and then be on his way to Mandoria 
        to</tt> <br>
        <tt>> bring down the enemy castle and trade guilds (should be a fun time 
        :-)</tt> 
      <p><tt>Don't forget my assassin can scout ahead, so we have target id numbers 
        for</tt> <br>
        <tt>you.</tt>
