      <p><b>From turn#124:</b></p>
      <p><tt>Hi all,</tt> </p>
      <p><tt>Another average turn.&nbsp; However, a couple of interesting things</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>occured.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- has anyone heard from Lord Bane recently?&nbsp; His faction 
        is going</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; stale.&nbsp; I gave them some money so more troops won't 
        desert.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Last I heard, he was going to England or someplace.&nbsp; 
        I guess</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; he's not home, yet.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- Some good luck, finally, persuading enemy nobles!</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7: Basilu [q0q] has been convinced to join us!</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 14: Diphtheria [o6u] has been convinced to join us!</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 21: Khaki Blazer [w4j] has been convinced to join us!</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 21: Hank McDougal [g4m] has been convinced to join us!</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was using "persuade oathbound", which supposedly 
        only</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; has a 2% success rate, but worked like a charm this turn.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- the "secret route" didn't lead to Mandoria.&nbsp; It only 
        went a</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; couple of provinces NW.&nbsp; I guess we will have to 
        fly eastward</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; across the sea to get to Mandoria after all...</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- We visioned the assassins again (at least the ones we know 
        about!):</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 15: Licia [i1l] receives a vision of Grey Blazer [c4r]:</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Assassinate Noble [9149], (Level 30)</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 15:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Conceal self [9593], (Level 11)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25: Licia [i1l] receives a vision of Sheila Carvalho 
        [x2r]:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Assassinate Noble [9149], (Level 31)</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Conceal self [9593], (Level 6)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Persuade oathbound noble [9536], (Level 3)</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        ^^^^^^^^</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note level 3 means they have been trying 
        to persuade either</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our nobles or refugees!)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; So they can still be caught.&nbsp; I'm sending a couple of 
        nobles out</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; to try to catch them...</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- The Mandorians built another castle and garrisoned some provinces!</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; They also lost 4 nobles that joined our side, and are 
        now below</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 total:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandor Confederacy:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Nobles (and controlled 
        units): 96.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Provinces controlled: 
        3.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cities controlled: 3.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Castles controlled: 3.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not that big of a deal, as destroying their 
        previous</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; castles has served its purpose well, and allowed us to 
        have time</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; to assemble a huge invasion party.&nbsp; I'll bet that 
        they have</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; "seekers" stationed outside these new castles...</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- of note:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o we have about 375 nazgul</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o we have 345 heavy xbowmen</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o we have 24 priests (11 Dol)</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Our troop maintenance is over 7000 gold each 
        month</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o we have 220,000 gold among our nobles, plus whatever 
        is</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the garrisons</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- The "small army" didn't leave Hyksos, yet, but should depart</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; on day#1 this turn.&nbsp; Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; 
        We had</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; money problems.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- 3-4 new Halon priests are being developed, and will be joining</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; the Hyksos army next turn.&nbsp; We will need to distribute</tt> 
      <p><tt>That's all for now.&nbsp; We will assemble the armies over the next</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>two turns, and then go kick some Mandorian butt.</tt>
