 <b>From turn#118: 
      </b> 
      <p><tt>I. Summary **************************************************************</tt> 
      </p>
      <p><tt>Things are really cranking up.&nbsp; There is a big enemy stack (though</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>beatable) in ap76, a new spy in ao74, and we collapsed the enemy</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>castle.&nbsp; There are also a few things we need to take care of</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>internally (pledge chain and hostile list), so please read carefully.</tt> 
      <p><tt>II. Collapse of the main enemy castle ***********************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>Our long-term plan to create chaos in Mandoria finally paid off:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;Calldwr [ad7o], city, in Mandor Mountains [ap23], in Mandoria</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp; 4: Calldwr Castle [e91] collapses!</tt> 
      <p><tt>Leaving this report in TGS:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp; Mandor Confederacy:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Nobles (and controlled 
        units): 108.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Provinces controlled: 
        1.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cities controlled: 1.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Castles controlled: 1.</tt> 
      <p><tt>They will now have to attack their own garrisons in order to replace 
        them</tt> <br>
        <tt>(70+ provinces!)&nbsp; Some of these may have considerable resources 
        or heavy</tt> <br>
        <tt>troops that they will lose at least part of.&nbsp; e.g.:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Garrison [cs8d], garrison, uncontrolled, with ten peasants,</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 soldiers, ten paladins, 21 wagons, five workers</tt> 
      <p><tt>III. Pledge chain *******************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>This is really messed up!</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;- Samantha Talltail [x9i] needs to pledge to Tiamat [t8b]</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;- Lanthara [r4v] needs to pledge to The Bard [s2a]</tt> 
      <p><tt>And it should fix all the problems we've been having.</tt> 
      <p><tt>IV. Troop maintenance ***************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>Everyone please make sure your troops have money.&nbsp; If they don't, 
        please</tt> <br>
        <tt>ask!&nbsp; Sunwalker [a8x], Firefly [f3f], and Johny [w2d] all lost 
        valuable</tt> <br>
        <tt>resources this turn:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30: Maintenance costs are 184 gold, can afford 
        63 gold.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30: Eight soldiers deserted.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30: Five lt. xbowmen left service.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30: Eight hvy. xbowmen left service.</tt> 
      <p><tt>and that was just the ones that I saw!</tt> 
      <p><tt>V. Other dumb mistakes **************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>Please clear the "hostile" list for every noble that you own (unless</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>you are seeking a spy).&nbsp; We had two nobles injured this turn 
        because</tt> <br>
        <tt>one was a former refugee on someone else's hostile list.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;4: > [auto-attack q0y]</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;4: Attack Franco [q0y].</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;4:&nbsp;&nbsp; Commanding 30 pikemen [16].</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;4:&nbsp;&nbsp; Commanding 16 workers [11].</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;4: We won!</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;4: Franco [q0y] is taken prisoner by Huehueteotl [c9d].</tt> 
      <p><tt>&lt;sigh></tt> 
      <p><tt>I've done this before, too, and it pains me to lose nobles for stupid</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>reasons.&nbsp; In battle with the enemy is one thing, but attacking 
        ourselves,</tt> <br>
        <tt>wandering in the wilderness and getting killed by nazgul --- these</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>are things we need to be really careful about.&nbsp; Every NP is needed...</tt> 
      <p><tt>VI. Prisoners ***********************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>We have two prisoners in Hyksos that can be bribed.&nbsp; Sir Arthur, 
        if you can't</tt> <br>
        <tt>do it, you can give one to Amanda [s7m] and one to Tiamat [t8b], and</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>I'll make a Dol priest and a 2nd Ham priest.</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prisoners:&nbsp; Andovar [i3s], refugee, health 100&nbsp; 
        - unsworn, CMIB 8, persuasion</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Lutra [a4w], Mandor Confederacy, health 100 - oath-1</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Gorgor [x7z], Mandor Confederacy, health 12 - ? - dying</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Eversilver [k5x], Mandor Confederacy, health 100 - contract-300?</tt> 
      <p><tt>So i3s and k5x are bribable, and we should do so ASAP.&nbsp; Also, 
        if</tt> <br>
        <tt>you will transfer a4w to Amanda [s7m], then I'll try to use "persuade</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>oathbound" right away.</tt> 
      <p><tt>VII. Battle Report (ap75) ***********************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>We defeated the gate guard, and injured a mage.&nbsp; Hope he doesn't 
        aura</tt> <br>
        <tt>blast one of our nobles on day#2:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;30: Stefano [t8e] is victorious!</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stefano lost ten soldiers, one archer, 
        one paladin, ten pikemen,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two nazgul.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur the Great lost five archers, ten 
        paladins, 35 pikemen,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 lt. xbowmen, five hvy. foot, five horse 
        archers.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur the Great [h3y] was taken prisoner.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnus Yobos [z6g] was wounded.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basilu [q0q] was taken prisoner.</tt> 
      <p><tt>VIII. Troops (us and them) **********************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>I've attached the spreadsheet with all of our troops.</tt> 
      <p><tt>The enemy stack is in ap76 moving west.&nbsp; Our big stack is in 
        ap75</tt> <br>
        <tt>(gate province).&nbsp; A large number of enemy mages are on the other</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>side of the gate.&nbsp; An enemy mage is in ap75 with our stack, but</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>he didn't cast any combat spells.&nbsp; That means he is either out</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>of aura or else doesn't know any combat spells. If he is not out</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>of aura, he *might* be able to either case an aura blast or</tt> <br>
        <tt>jump through the gate before we could attack him on day#2 (if we</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>choose to do that).</tt> 
      <p><tt>It is possible that they could send mages though the gate to link</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>up with their army, but I'm not sure that would help them too much.</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>More likely that they will stop movement and run.</tt> 
      <p><tt>Let's discuss this.&nbsp; We should easily defeat them in a confrontation,</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>but we may want to use our plan of sending nazgul and heavy xbows</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>to hunt them down in our lands</tt> 
      <p><tt>FYI, the nobles at the other end of the gate (ap20) are:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;Inner locations:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fawlty Tower [m25], tower, defense 20</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hall of Dreams [r20], tower, defense 20, owner:</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthony the Wierd [a5j], Mandor 
        Confederacy, master of the black</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arts</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Argyle the Fool [s5z], Mandor 
        Confederacy, lord, 4th black circle</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uruk 5 [w77], tower, defense 20, owner:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lungor [y4r], Mandor Confederacy, lord, 
        sorcerer</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;Seen here:</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garrison [cs8d], garrison, uncontrolled, with ten 
        peasants,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 soldiers, ten paladins, 21 wagons, five workers</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrian the Stout [l2g], Mandor Confederacy, mage, 
        with four pikemen,</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two winged horses</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rilkor [f9i], Mandor Confederacy, with five soldiers</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simon [y5j], Mandor Confederacy, 6th black circle, 
        with one dirt golem</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen Xiao [c4g], Mandor Confederacy, with 18 soldiers, 
        ten lt. xbowmen</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigno [h1h], Mandor Confederacy, lord, "Calldwr 
        Alliance", with</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten workers, three wagons, ten hvy. wagons, ten 
        peasants</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lierin [p1n], Mandor Confederacy, lord, 5th black 
        circle</tt> 
      <p><tt>Guys -- you may want to stay clear of ap75 until that</tt> <br>
        <tt>army is gone.</tt> 
      <p><tt>IX. Enemy spies *********************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>Manis moved from the Hyksos castle out into the province to "seek" 
        and</tt> <br>
        <tt>to catch any enemy nobles who he might find.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
        stupid</tt> <br>
        <tt>monster attacks depleted his troops, and when he found one, he lost</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>the battle and was captured:</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;24: Found Grey Blazer [c4r].</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: > [auto-attack c4r]</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: Attack Grey Blazer [c4r].</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: We lost!</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: Manis [h3g] is wounded.&nbsp; Health is now 60.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: Manis [h3g] has fallen ill.</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;25: Manis [h3g] is taken prisoner by Grey Blazer [c4r].</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manis [h3g] is being held prisoner.</tt> <br>
        &nbsp; 
      <p><tt>Grey Blazer was last seen in ao74.</tt> 
      <p><tt>*************************************************************************</tt> 
      <p><tt>Well -- let's fix our problems, and catch the enemy army!&nbsp; We 
        need</tt> <br>
        <tt>to factor in all the possible things they could do, so I'm counting</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>on you experienced generals to chip in some ideas...</tt>
