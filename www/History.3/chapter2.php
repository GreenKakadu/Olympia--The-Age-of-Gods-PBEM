      <h3>Turn #70 (Trollwood mage attacks)</h3>
      A large Imperial force in Mandoria attacks and captures/kills <u>four</u> 
      mages in Trollwood [ap20]!&nbsp; (<a href="turn70.php">Battle Report</a>) 
      We expect that this was the location of the gate that was used to send Vulpo's 
      force to Imperia.&nbsp; The Bouncy Castle is torn to the ground by the Imperial 
      forces.&nbsp; This leaves one Mandorian castle on the Mandorian continent, 
      one on Tenka, and one on Imperia at Ilya.&nbsp; The Pen now have their own 
      castle on Catarack.&nbsp; Imperial castles reside at Hyksos and Thorbardin. 
      <p>In Imperia, Tinky Winky moves to [as73], west of Lookfar and south of 
        Hyksos. 
      <h3> Turn #71</h3>
      Our assassin, Eidolon, enters Ilya and scouts out the situation.&nbsp; There 
      are a just a couple of Mandorian nobles there, catching horses and training 
      troops.&nbsp; Bufo enters the Hyksos province and attacks two nobles who 
      have left the castle, then slips away to the south. (<a href="turn71.php">Reports</a>) 
      <h3> Turn #72</h3>
      Eidolon assassinates the Ilya castle holder and one other noble, then sets 
      the garrisons hostile to other Mandorians who were seen in the area.&nbsp; 
      (<a href="turn72.php">Reports</a>)&nbsp; Bufo attacks an Imperial noble 
      outside of Rylla in [ap70], while Tinky Winky's forces invade Eadweard in 
      [aq71] (<a href="turn72-2.php">Battle Reports</a>)&nbsp; Imperial forces 
      led by Jupiter attack a Mandorian garrison at Newbald in the Mandor Mountains 
      [ao22].&nbsp; A very large, very nasty stack of Mandorians, led by Trolnak, 
      are hot on their trail.&nbsp; (<a href="turn72-3.php">Reports</a>) 
      <h3> Turn #73 (Battle of Thorbardin)</h3>
      The tide continues to turn, as Bufo's force suicidally attacks a fully loaded 
      castle in the First Battle of Thorbardin!&nbsp; 10 Mandorian nobles are 
      taken prisoner.&nbsp; (<a href="turn73.php">Battle Report</a>)&nbsp; Tinky 
      Winky's force ransacks Imperial City and the surrounding province as a hidden 
      Imperial watches, and then heads east to meet reinforcements: Hashfarn McBarnes 
      and friends. (<a href="turn73-2.php">Reports</a>) 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (sung ala Pearl Jam:)</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; [refrain]</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh where oh where could my Bufo be?</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Imps took him away from me</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; He's gone to Hades and I've got to sure</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; That I can join my Bufo when I leave this world...</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in Thorbardin on a Friday night</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; We were lookin' for a fight</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; There in the road, up straight ahead</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; A castle was there, but we were brain-dead</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn't stop, so we charged at the sight</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll never forget the sounds that night</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; The screamin' nazgul, they kicked our ass</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; We painfully fled and from life we passed...</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; [refrain]</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; --- The Mystery Bard of Thorbardin</tt> 
      <p>In Mandoria, Jupiter's army recruits and trains men outside of Newbald. 
      <h3> Turn #74</h3>
      Athos, Cathy, and Bufo escape from Thorbardin by slipping out in the fog 
      and waiting for the Imperial hunting party headed by Sunwalker to pass. 
      Bufo dies from his wounds, but the other two nobles join up with Tinky Winky.&nbsp; 
      (<a href="turn74.php">Report</a>)&nbsp; The Aztec Glory faction discovers 
      an abandoned castle southwest of Imperial City in [ar66].&nbsp; This makes 
      the third Imperial castle in Imperia. 
      <p>A new group of Mandorians is discovered in Brine City. (<a href="turn74-2.php">Report</a>) 
      <p>Jupiter's army flees to [ao25], with Tronlak's stack hot on their trail. 
      <h3> Turn #75</h3>
      Tinky Winky's stack arrives outside of Throbardin on day#30 after taking 
      out the garrison.&nbsp; Imperial noble Skydancer is all alone in the province, 
      and looks like he may be toast (<a href="turn75.php">Report</a>). 
      <p>The Imperials <a href="turn75-2.php">hatch a plan</a>.&nbsp; Most of 
        the enemy prisoners are executed to keep them from being freed by the 
        enemy. 
      <p>In Mandoria, Jupiter's army is badly outnumbered, but that doesn't stop 
        them from slaying more Mandorians as they <a href="turn75-3.php">recklessly 
        tear across the countryside</a> with Trolnak only a couple of days behind 
        them. 
      <h3> Turn #76 (Second Battle of Thorbardin)</h3>
      At Thorbardin, the Mandorians take the bait and attack Skydancer, resulting 
      in the glorious <a href="turn76.php">Second Battle of Thorbardin</a>.&nbsp; 
      Mandorian tombstones kept popping up outside of the city: 
      <p>More new Mandorian tombstones outside Thorbardin this turn, as reported 
        in The Gods Speak: 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;Here lies Tinky Winky</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;His strategy was really stinky</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here lies Hashfarn McBarnes</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wolfies ate his little arms</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
        of Tinky's followers was The Noo-noo</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he's 
        dead.&nbsp; Woo!&nbsp; Woo!</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown Blazer's bones are buried here</tt> <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; A good lunch he made my wolfie dears</tt> 
      <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cathy escaped once, but not again</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head is on a pike in Thorbardin</tt> 
      <p><tt>Thorbardin welcomes all Mandorians seeking a similar fate.&nbsp; 
        If you</tt> <br>
        <tt>let us know you are coming, we can provide an even more pleasant</tt> 
        <br>
        <tt>welcoming party!</tt> 
      <p>Imperia is finally free from Mandorians, at least for a while, after 
        five long years of brutal warfare that has left our lands ravaged. 
      <p>Jupiter enters Mandor City, capturing two enemy assassins.&nbsp; Trolnak 
        is only two days behind.&nbsp; It has been a fun party in Mandor, but 
        it is time to run away and live to fight another day.
